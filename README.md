Welcome to my app!

## Getting Started

Lets go through how we install this thing

### Android

Android is pretty simple, there is an APK buried in the files.

- Drag the APK file over to your Android phone, either download it or drop it into your emulator
- Once downloaded make sure you enable 'Install from Unknown sources' in the system settings on your phone
- Download and install.

### iOS

iOS is little more trickier when it comes to being able to install the app

- You will need to open this project and install onto an iOS simulator


### A little more info and tid bits you can do

The tab_view is the main navigation point of the app, you can go between each task using the tab navigation

- On the top right there is color picker button, you can slip between dark and light mode
- When you send a message, the messages are simulated and there is just random responses each time you reply
- The Pokedex screen and the Avatars on the chat screen are the only things effected by internet being unavailable
- There is little slide in animations when moving up and down the chat screen
- Pokemon detail can be seen by pressing on them and little fade-ins happen with the title.
- You can also scroll fully upwards on the Pokedex detail to give more space and 'Close the Pokeball'
- You can see the participants of the chat using the top right icon, which presents a bottom sheet.
- The little icon animations you see are Lottie animations
